# Maze Solver

This project involves building a visual interface in Python that draws, solves, and animates a maze. Using Python and Tkinter, you'll create a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows you to visualize various maze-solving algorithms. The application will generate randomized mazes and then systematically solve them.

## Features

- **Maze Generation:** Create and display randomized mazes.
- **Algorithm Visualization:** Visualize the process of different maze-solving algorithms.
- **Animation:** Animate the maze-solving process to show the algorithm in action.
- **GUI with Tkinter:** Build a user-friendly interface to interact with the maze and algorithms.

## Tools and Libraries

- **Python 3.x:** Programming language used for this project.
- **Tkinter:** Standard GUI toolkit for Python to build the visual interface.
- **Random:** For generating randomized mazes.
- **Time:** For managing and controlling animation speeds and delays.
- **Algorithms:** Implementations of various maze-solving algorithms (e.g., DFS, BFS).
